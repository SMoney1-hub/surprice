      <h2>💌 A Letter from My Heart</h2>
      <p>
        My Dearest Anike,<br><br>
      
        On this beautiful day that brought you into this world, I just want to pause time and let you know how truly cherished you are.  
        You are the heartbeat in my silence, the light in my shadows, and the calm to every storm I face.  
        With every passing day, I find myself falling deeper in love with your soul, your smile, your warmth.  
        You’ve turned ordinary days into memories I never want to forget, and every moment with you feels like magic. ✨<br><br>
      
        I may not always have the perfect words, but I carry you in every beat of my heart.  
        Loving you has taught me patience, happiness, and a kind of peace I never knew I needed.  
        You are my sunshine on the darkest days, my safe place, my forever.  
        I don’t need a thousand wishes — I just need one lifetime, with you in it. 💖<br><br>
      
        I celebrate you today, and always.  
        Thank you for being mine.<br><br>
      
        With all the love my heart can hold,<br>
